This is my honours project. It is the continuation of the 7 Wonders project made in Comp 3007.
My supervisor is JP Corriveau.

This project's aim is to use the existing codebase ("legacy code") for a 7 Wonders application and expand it to support the 7 Wonders Leaders expansion features.

This project has successfully implemented major features of the new expansion, including all new cards, Leaders and Recruitment phase, and both sides of the new Rome board, as well as a suite of expansion compatible AIs, of which each utilize different strategies.

Although major gameplay features have been implemented, many other improvements are possible with this application, including:

- making the UI scale (UI elements are currently fixed)
- fixing non-game UI elements, such as making the player/AI list in the TableUI work (currently not being used)
- support restarting a game during or after a played game without having to restart the entire application
- fixing stability issues
