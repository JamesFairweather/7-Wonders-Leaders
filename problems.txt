UI problems:
  - UI is too crowded.  Change it to be a scrollable horizontal panel with one player state in each panel that's much larger.  Should be large enough to show complete state of plus both neighbors.
  - Can we use other nicknames?
  - Some cards do not have icons.
  - it would be nice if PlayerStatePanels were created dynamically so we maximized our use of space on the Main Window.
    The current behavior is that all 8 panels are created statically and only the ones in use are activated.
  - Conflict tokens and losses could be presented using icons instead of text labels.

Commerce issues:
	- brown cards that give 2 of a resource don't work
	- possibly the either/or first age cards don't work right either.  Need to do a detailed analysis of how the
	  resources are walked.  The algorithm should look like:
		* if the card cost is zero, or the parent was built, the card can be built for free
		* if not, check the resources of the player.  Starting with the singles or doubles, then the either/or, then the forum/caravansery, the Leader who give a resource-1 cost for that card type.
		* if still not, commerce is required.  Combine the players plus the two neighbor's resources into one list.
		  as with the single player, go through the singles, doubles, either/or cards, caravansery/forum, then bilkis.  The either/or cards are the most challenging
		  as every possible combination must be checked before the cost is said to be impossible.  I.e. using the first resource of an either/or might make it not possible
		  to afford it but choosing the other one could mean the structure _is_ affordable.  So every possible combination must be checked before the isCardAffordable returns
		  false, and I don't think it's checking every possible combination.
	- Initial Commerce request from the server should include the card name
	- response from the server would be:
		- resouce/commerce/Wonders the player can use (P=Timber Yard,Stone Pit,Caravansery,etc)
		- data affecting commerce (discounts, leaders that affect commerce)
		- L=west neighbor's resource cards (L=Clay Pit,Tree Farm,...)
		- R=east neighbor's resourde cards (R=Mine,Quarry,...)
	- Submit data from client should look like: BldStrct&Structure=<Card Name>&CommerceData=true&Player=W/Clay Pit&Player=S/Quarry&Player=S/Quarry&Left=W/Tree Farm&Right=G/Glassworks
		- Commerce Data is only required for structures that require it.
		- The card name can be WonderStagen, n { 1, 2, 3, 4 }

AI players
	- Could be improved a lot without much effort
	- Take advantage of commerce ability
	- Don't overplay military
	- Go for sets in science
	- Take advantage of Wonder effects.
	- Look at what other cards have been played to guess what's coming in the next hand.

Technical stories:

- I want to get rid of the remaining "Serializable" objects

- The list of players (the datagrid) isn't hooked up at the match-making.

- The protocol for the client/server communication is quite a lot more verbose than it needs to be.  Surely the server should wait for each client to make his choice, then broadcast the card each player played to every
  other player.  Instead, it sends the whole game state to every player after each turn.
	- stil working on this.

- it would be nice to use data binding, if I can figure it out.

- the game doesn't terminate nicely when it's shut down.  Must kill it.
