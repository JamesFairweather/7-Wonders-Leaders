UI problems:
  - It needs to be more obvious when a player has made their selection and is waiting on the other players to make theirs
  - UI is too crowded.  Change it to be a scrollable horizontal panel with one player state in each panel that's much larger.  Should be large enough to show complete state of plus both neighbors.
  - it would be nice if PlayerStatePanels were created dynamically so we maximized our use of space on the Main Window.
    The current behavior is that all 8 panels are created statically and only the ones in use are activated.
  - The UI needs to make it more obvious after the player has played his card for that turn.
  - It would be nice to make a notification when someone pays you for using your resources

Commerce issues:
	- Submit data from client should look like: BldStrct&Structure=<Card Name>&CommerceData=true&Player=W/Clay Pit&Player=S/Quarry&Player=S/Quarry&Left=W/Tree Farm&Right=G/Glassworks
		- Commerce Data is only required for structures that require it.
		- The card name can be WonderStagen, n { 1, 2, 3, 4 }
	- We're currently using the effects, which in some ways is better (simpler), but the real weakness is that the client just sends back "build this structure and pay my left neighbor 1 coin and my right one 3 coins"
	  If I want to be serious about this, that's not an appropriate response.  Client must include which cards were used so the server can validate the transaction.  Still, I suppose you could just pass back which
	  resources were used on either side rather than a few coins.  It would still be fairly easy to calculate what's going on.

AI players
	- Could be improved a lot without much effort
	- Take advantage of commerce ability
	- Don't overplay military
	- Go for sets in science
	- Take advantage of Wonder effects.
	- Look at what other cards have been played to guess what's coming in the next hand.

Technical stories:

- There is a problem when Babylon B's power is activated and Halikarnassos builds a free build wonder stage
  with their 6th card.  Babylon B must play first, then Halikarnassos can play.  Will need to use a 2nd client
  to run through this logic.

- Should probably have a way to distinguish between the table host (creates the game and may add AI players) vs.
  non-hosts - cannot add AI players.

- Need a way to re-roll the wonder boards.  Probably need a host player for that feature, otherwise it's too
  easy to abuse.  Game should not begin until all players have confirmed acceptance of their boards.

- Remove Byzantium from 3-player games.

- On a normal turn, there should just one message exchanged: server sends game state to the client:
	 - what cards were just played by the other players
	 - what cards are in the player's hand, and their buildable states
	 - all data affecting commerce - what resources the player has, what resources each neighbor has, the next buildable
	   wonder stage, and what commercial discount effects are in place.
	- client sends what card was selected and a list of which resources were used.

- when you build a card from the discard pile, do you get the leader effect (e.g. if you build a commercial structure
  and you have Xenonphon, do you get the 2 extra coins?)

- If you build a Press with Halikarnassos free build from the discard pile, it may not find the "right" press
  as the one in Age 2 is different from the one in Age 1.

- Make the card selection UI into a separate window.  See if there's a nicer-looking control for it.
