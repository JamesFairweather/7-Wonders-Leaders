MainWindow constructor

- create Coordinator
- load GUI

showPlayerBarPanel(String playerBarPanelInformation)

viewDetailsButtonPressed()
handleViewDetails(String information)

showHandPanel(String information)
showActionPanel(String message)

- problem: in cardActionButtonPressed, state variable "playerPlayedHisTurn" is being kept in MainWindow. Should be in coordinator
- problem: in showBoardImage, state variable "gameRunning" is being kept in MainWindow.

In coordinator, possibly get rid of interpretUIAction and divide it into different functions

Fix the Special Powers hacks that I did. handleSpecialEndOfAgePower() is problematic. 

Have receiveMessage in GMCoordinator, keep the initial letters, but theres too many state tracking in this class. Redistribute the functionalities
	to GameManager. For example, upon receiving a "J" message (join game) in GMCoordinator, should not keep track of amount of players in the GMCoordinator
	class (via numOfPlayers++). Instead, should delegate these things GameManager by calling gameManager.joinPlayer(nickname, message) or something.

In GameManager, is board_amount (line 13) required? Can I not figure this out by having numOfPlayers?

For Player, look into storeAction(String s). How to make it so that an object representing actions are passed, instead of strings (may not be necessary)

In GameManager, updateGameUI is where the serialization needs to happen. Start with this.
