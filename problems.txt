MainWindow constructor

- create Coordinator
- load GUI

showPlayerBarPanel(String playerBarPanelInformation)

viewDetailsButtonPressed()
handleViewDetails(String information)

showHandPanel(String information)
showActionPanel(String message)

- problem: in cardActionButtonPressed, state variable "playerPlayedHisTurn" is being kept in MainWindow. Should be in coordinator
- problem: in showBoardImage, state variable "gameRunning" is being kept in MainWindow.

For Player, look into storeAction(String s). How to make it so that an object representing actions are passed, instead of strings (may not be necessary)

In GameManager, updateGameUI is where the serialization needs to happen. Start with this.
