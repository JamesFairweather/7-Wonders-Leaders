The UI is missing a bunch of information:
- The resource/material that the city board produces is not depicted (the boards can be rescanned)
- The overall game state is less than clear - what cards the player has played, and what cards the other players have played, military victories and losses
- The last card played by each player isn't obvious
- The list of players (the datagrid) isn't hooked up at the match-making.

The AI seems weak, although the "difficult" setting may be smarter
